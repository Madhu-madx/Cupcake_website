# 🧁 Cupcake Store – Web Application

## 📌 Overview

The **Cupcake Store** is a web-based food ordering application developed to demonstrate practical skills in web design and basic full-stack development. The project allows users to browse cupcake items, view details, and place orders, while providing an admin-side interface to manage food items and customer orders. The application was built and tested in a local environment using XAMPP.
